![DLAI](images/Screen-Shot-2018-04-01-at-1.33.45-PM.png)



This Specialization is an introduction to Deep Learning taught by Andrew
Ng. It consists of five courses, which cover the foundations of Deep Learning, how to build neural networks, and how to lead successful machine learning projects. Topics such as Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more were covered. Python, Keras and TensorFlow were used.

### Courses

1. **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**

    In this course the foundations of deep learning were introduced.


2. **Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization**

    This course taught the *"magic"* of getting deep learning to work well. Topics
    covered:
    - industry best-practices for building deep learning applications
    - common neural network *"tricks"* including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, batch normalization, and gradient checking
    - a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, momentum, RMSprop and Adam and check for their convergence
    - understand new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance
    - how to implement a neural network in TensorFlow

3. **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**

    This course is concerned with how to build a successful machine learning project.
    Topics covered:
    - how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system and how to prioritize the most promising directions for reducing error
    - complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance
    - how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning

4. **Convolutional Neural Networks**


    This course teaches how to build convolutional neural networks and apply it to image data. Topics covered:
    - how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks
    - how to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks
    - how to use neural style transfer to generate art
    - application of these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data.

5. **Sequence Models**

    This course teaches how to build models for natural language, audio, and other sequence data. Topics covered:
    - how to build and train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and commonly-used variants such as GRUs and LSTMs
    - application of sequence models to natural language problems, including text synthesis
    - application of sequence models to audio applications, including speech recognition and music synthesis


## 2. Udemy: [The Ultimate MySQL Bootcamp: Go from SQL Beginner to Expert](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/)


This 20 hour course is a gentle but comprehensive introduction to SQL and MySQL.
It covers such things as:

- MySQL DBMS

- Analyse data using Aggregate Functions
- SQL joins
- How to create databases and interacting with existing databases
- How to work with large datasets
- Write complex SQL queries across multiple tables
- Design and implement complex database schemas
- Database triggers
- Model real-world data and generate reports using SQL
- Answer company performance or sales questions using data
- Build a web app using NodeJS and MySQL
- Write Javascript code to generate fake data sets
